Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); 28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966), commonly known as 'Swatantryaveer Savarkar' in Marathi language,[2] was an Indian independence activist and politician who formulated the Hindu nationalist philosophy of Hindutva.[3][4] He was a leading figure in the Hindu Mahasabha.[5]

As a response to the Muslim League, Savarkar joined the Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva (Hinduness),[6] previously coined by Chandranath Basu,[7] to create a collective "Hindu" identity as an essence of Bharat (India).[8][9] Savarkar was an atheist and also a pragmatic practitioner of Hindu philosophy.

Savarkar began his political activities as a high school student and continued to do so at Fergusson College in Pune.[10] He and his brother founded a secret society called Abhinav Bharat Society. When he went to the United Kingdom for his law studies, he involved himself with organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means.[11] One of the books he published called The Indian War of Independence about the Indian rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British authorities. In 1910, Savarkar was arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with the revolutionary group India House.
